# Express.js Note Taker

![License](https://img.shields.io/badge/license-MIT-blue)

## Description
We were tasked to modify the starter code to create an application called 'Note Taker'. The purpose of Note Taker is too write and save notes that a user inputs. Having been provided with the front end the challenge was about connecting the back end to the front end and then deploying the entire application to Heroku. 

This was an important exercise as it was an opportunity to implement the skills and knowdlege we had learnt over the past week about express.js. 

The main takeaway i learnt from this exercise was you need to have a good file structure so that you can easily connect the front end and back end together. Additionally it is important to understand when to use GET, POST and DELETE methods. 

To give the application on Heroku click here: [View application on Heroku](https://mwest-note-taker.herokuapp.com/)
